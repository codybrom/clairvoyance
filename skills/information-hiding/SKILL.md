# Information Hiding Review Lens

When invoked with $ARGUMENTS, focus the analysis on the specified file or module. Read the target code first, then apply the checks below.

Evaluate whether modules encapsulate design decisions effectively.

## When to Apply

- Reviewing module boundaries or class decomposition decisions
- When multiple modules change together for single-decision changes
- When private fields have matching getters and setters
- When modules are organized around execution steps (read/process/write)
- When a format, protocol, or representation appears in multiple places

## Core Principles

### Knowledge Ownership Test

**For every design decision in the code** (data format, algorithm choice, protocol, storage representation):

1. Which module owns this decision?
2. Is that ownership exclusive — no other module knows this?
3. If this decision changes, does only one module need editing?

If #3 is "no," there is information leakage.

### Two Kinds of Leakage

#### Interface Leakage

The decision appears in parameters, return types, or exceptions. Bad, but at least visible and discoverable.

#### Back-Door Leakage

Two or more modules encode the decision in their implementations with nothing in the code surface making the dependency visible. This maps directly to unknown unknowns — a developer modifying one module has no signal the other must change. **More pernicious than interface leakage for exactly this reason.**

Signs of back-door leakage:

- Changing an internal data structure breaks a seemingly unrelated module
- Two modules must be updated in lockstep but have no direct API dependency
- Shared assumptions about file formats, message ordering, or naming conventions that exist only in developers' heads
- Tests that break in module B when module A's internals change

Not all dependencies are eliminable. Transforming a hidden dependency into an obvious one is often more valuable than trying to remove it — at least then the next developer knows to look.

### The Temporal Decomposition Trap

**The most common cause of information leakage.** Code structured around "first do X, then do Y, then do Z" scatters knowledge across steps. When code is split into a "read the file" step and a "parse the file" step, both modules must understand the file format. Draw boundaries around knowledge domains, not execution phases — a module that reads AND writes a format owns that format exclusively. Merging the two steps produces one module with a simpler interface and no shared assumptions.

This fails at larger scales too: microservices split along workflow stages scatter shared protocol knowledge across service boundaries.

### "Private Is Not Hiding"

Declaring a field `private` and providing getters/setters does not hide information. Callers know the field exists, its type, its name, and that they can read and write it.

> "The nature and usage of the variables are just as exposed as if the variables were public." — John Ousterhout, _A Philosophy of Software Design_

**Test:** Does the caller need this information to use the module correctly? If no, it should be genuinely invisible — not just access-controlled.

### Partial Hiding Has Value

Information hiding is not all-or-nothing. If a feature is only needed by a few users and accessed through separate methods not visible in common use cases, it is mostly hidden — creating fewer dependencies than information visible to every user. Design for the common case to be simple; rare cases can require extra methods.

### Hiding Within a Class

Information hiding applies inside a class too, not just at its boundary. Design private methods so each encapsulates some capability hidden from the rest of the class. Minimize the number of places where each instance variable is used — fewer internal access points means fewer internal dependencies.

### Don't Hide What Callers Need

Information hiding only makes sense when the hidden information isn't needed outside the module. If callers genuinely need something — performance-tuning parameters, configuration that varies by use case — it must be exposed. The goal is to minimize the _amount_ of information needed outside, not to hide everything unconditionally.

### Leakage Through Over-Specialization

When a general-purpose module is given knowledge of specific higher-level operations, information leaks upward. When a general-purpose data layer defines methods like `archiveExpiredItems`, it encodes business-rule knowledge — any change to the expiration policy forces a data-layer change. This is the special-general mixture red flag.

## Review Process

1. **Inventory design decisions** — List formats, algorithms, protocols, data structures, representation choices
2. **Map ownership** — For each, identify which module(s) know about it
3. **Flag leakage** — Any decision known by more than one module is leaking
4. **Check for temporal decomposition** — Are boundaries drawn around steps or knowledge?
5. **Audit getters/setters** — Are any "private" fields effectively public through accessors?
6. **Propose consolidation** — Merge the knowing modules, or extract shared knowledge into a single owner with a genuinely abstract interface

Red flag signals for information hiding are cataloged in **red-flags** (Information Leakage, Temporal Decomposition, Overexposure).
